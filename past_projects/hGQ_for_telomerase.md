# Human G-Quadruplex Controls for Studying Processive Behavior of Telomerase

## Fall 2018 - Fall 2019
## with the Comstock Lab in association with the Schmidt Lab


## Background
Cancer is one of the largest causes of death in first world countries. Decades of research have gone into developing cancer treatments. However, a major question in biology is understanding cancer's emergence from molecular processes. A major proponent in 90% of cancers is the activation of the protein Telomerase, a proponent in extending the number of cell generations.

### What is the role of Telomerase?
A basic process of life is to replicate its genetic code for the next generation. As organisms become more complex, genomic replication also increases in complexity. This is especially true for organisms that do not have circular plasmids to carry their genome, such as humans who have linear chromosomes. Every time a human chromosome is duplicated some of the ends of the chromosome are chopped off. Luckily, there is a built in telomeric repeat that is not vital to be transcribed. Most cells would deplete this "telomere" in 50-70 duplications (read more about the Hayflick Limit). Some cells need to be constantly replicated, such as stem cells, gametes, and epidermal cells. Telomerase activates and adds extra telomeric repeats to build up the buffer. Therefore, the cells have nearly limitless reproduction potential.

However, this limitless reproduction is a crucial part of cancer survival. Major cancers activate telomerase so they can continuously reproduce and their growth expounds without cell death. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of telomerase, how it adds repeats to chromosomes, is vital both for understanding how telomerase fails in certain diseases and how we could inhibit it in cancerous cells to prevent uncontrolled growth.


## Controls for processive telomerase observation
Observing the processive behavior of a single telomerase complex adding telomeric repeats is a long sought after question in single-molecule biophysics. As an undergraduate researcher in the Comstock Lab, we worked with the Schmidt Lab and postdoc Eric Patrick to observe this processive behavior. My primary contribution to the project was to run experimental controls on the human G-Quadruplex (hGQ) structure, a structure that forms from single stranded DNA in a non-canonical base pairing interaction. We used our optical trapping apparatus to clarify some of the unexpected telomerase behavior being observed. I did this in a team with researcher and co-author Bramyn Payne and fellow undergraduate researcher Lauren Jernstadt.

## Techniques

### Construct Design

To use an optical trap, one cannot directly expose the structure of interest to the intense lasers required to keep an object controlled. Therefore, we designed multiple constructs with hGQ in between a DNA linker that attached to beads that are held in the trap. The multiple designs were necessary to narrow down the odd behavior of the construct.


### Constant Force Single Molecule Optical Trapping

We utilized the high resolution traps ability to maintain constant pico-Newton forces (approximately 7 billionths the force to pick a penny off the ground and put it in your pocket) to measure the extension of single hGQ structures as a function of time. We used this to estimate average kinetic rates of hGQ structure formation and deformation, similar to how one would classify a folded and unfolded state in a protein.


### Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Optical Tweezers (Fleezers)

To increase resolution accuracy and answer more unsolved problems with our construct, we utilized our instruments ability to simultaneously trap beads to measure extension or force and measure the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a labeled construct.
