# Coherent Diffraction Imaging Reconstruction of Gold Superlattice Self-Assembly

## Spring 2021
## in association with the Ginsberg Group

### Background
Understanding how individual constituents of a massive object come together is a problem that spans many disciplines, but is especially prevalent in chemistry and nanoscale physics. In particular, to engineer nanoscale photonics, driven self-assembly into custom patterns
