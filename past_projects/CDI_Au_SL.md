# Coherent Diffraction Imaging Reconstruction of Gold Superlattice Self-Assembly

## Spring 2021
## in association with the Ginsberg Group

### Background

Understanding how individual constituents of a massive object come together is a problem that spans many disciplines, but is especially prevalent in chemistry and nanoscale physics. In particular, engineering nanoscale photonics through driven self-assembly into custom patterns is a sought after technique.

One interesting example of self-assembly is coating conducting (gold) or dielectric (lead sulfate) nanoparticle lattices approximately 4 nm in size in ion-rich ligands. These particles are colloids that are usually individual in low ion solutions. However, when placed in an ion-rich solution, they are naturally driven to assemble into larger superlattices (since they are now lattices of lattices).

Recently, physical chemists have been able to sizably increase the packing factor of these superlattices and make superlattices with unique conducting properties. By understanding this mechanism, opening the doors of engineering nanoscale objects in solution becomes plausible.

### SLSA

As a rotation student in Naomi Ginsberg's Lab, I became familiar with small angle coherent x-ray experiments and analyzing diffraction pattern data.


### Techniques

In order to study real-time self-assembly in a solution, one is required to perform complicated beamline experiments. Direct light microscopy is ill-fitted to observe nanometer sized structure due to diffraction limited resolution. However, X-rays are photons with the correct light characteristics to observe the intrasuperlattice spacing.
