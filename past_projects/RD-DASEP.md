# Project RD-DASEP: Recruiting Defect Disordered Asymmetric Exclusion Process

## Fall 2021
## in association with the Limmer Group



## Background
The **D**isordered **As**ymmetric **E**xclusion **P**rocess (DASEP) is a well-studied chemical model to describe one-dimensional motion on a discrete lattice occupied by particles that move in a preferential direction. It is named thusly:
- Disordered: The rate a particle moves from one lattice site to the next can vary depending on location
- Asymmetric: Particles have a preferential direction of movement. If they can only move in one direction, then it is deemed totally asymmetric
- Exclusion: Two particles cannot simultaneously occupy the same site, nor can particles "jump" over another particle



## Project RD-DASEP
My project in association with the Limmer Group was to expand the DASEP model to fit in the framework of MAP-motor interactions as studied in the Yildiz Lab.
